# POM
# Create a new folder: Locators
# Within Locators create a new file: id.py
# add the following code:

class Users():

    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password

mf = Users('michael.figelman', 'password')

# The class instance above will create a user class
# set a variable equal to that class and pass in a username and password argument
